1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
────────────────────
The NITE-PEI Integrated Thesis Engine (News Impact and Thesis Engine for
Prospective Event Intelligence Probability Updating) has been fully engineered,
implemented, tested, and verified across 6 phases under Work Order WO-20260621-002.

All 11 new Python modules, 2 new data files, 1 new unit test file, and 4 modified
configuration artefacts have been delivered. The SOP Step 4–10 execution protocol
was followed without deviation. The full test suite (305 tests) passes with zero
failures and zero regressions.

Governance invariants are enforced in code:
  - manual_execution_required = True in all output dicts
  - llm_order_generation = False in all NITE-PEI modules
  - order_routing_enabled = False throughout
  - VXX/VIXY permanently excluded from equity_action_gate (frozenset constant)
  - Hedge positions governed exclusively by hedge_action_gate (BLV3-DOCTRINE-007)

3. ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
────────────────────────

3.1 SEVEN SUB-ENGINES (E1–E7)
──────────────────────────────

  E1  Event Classifier (event_classifier.py)
      Input:  headline text, ticker_tags, source_tier (1–4)
      Output: {event_class, noise_discount_factor, affected_tickers}
      Method: Deterministic keyword taxonomy (22 classes); reverse-indexed at import.
              Source tier discount: T1→0%, T2→10%, T3→25%, T4→50%.

  E2  Likelihood Ratio Table (likelihood_ratio_table.yaml)
      Structure: lr_table[event_class][thesis_type] = {lr, confidence, calibration_n}
      Defaults:  UNKNOWN/ANY → LR=1.0 (no update); locked entries: calibration_n=999.
      Update:    Written by brier_calibration_loop.py only; no runtime mutation.

  E3  Bayesian Updater (bayesian_updater.py)
      Formula:   prior_odds = p/(1-p)
                 posterior_odds = prior_odds × LR_adjusted
                 p_posterior = post_odds/(1+post_odds)
                 Clamped to [0.05, 0.95]
      LR Adjust: lr_adjusted = lr × (1 - noise_discount_factor)
      Multi-event: Sequential — posterior_N becomes prior_N+1.

  E4  Kill-Condition State Machine (kill_condition_state_machine.py)
      States:    INACTIVE (P_kill < 0.10)
                 WATCH    (P_kill ∈ [0.10, 0.35))
                 TRIGGERED (P_kill ∈ [0.35, 0.65))
                 CONFIRMED (P_kill ≥ 0.65)
                 RETIRED   (manual CIO assignment)
      Trigger:   event_class match against each kill condition's trigger list.
      Output:    Updated kill_conditions list; worst_kill_state(); snapshot dict.

  E5  CKRI Calculator (ckri_calculator.py)
      Formula:   weighted_sum = Σ(kill_weight_i × P_kill_i)
                 n_correlated = Σ max(0, count-1) per shared trigger class
                 ckri_raw = weighted_sum + 0.15 × n_correlated
                 ckri = ckri_raw / Σ kill_weight_i
      Zones:     CLEAR [0, 0.20) | WATCH [0.20, 0.40) | ELEVATED [0.40, 0.60)
                 HIGH [0.60, 0.80) | CRITICAL [0.80, ∞)
      Audit:     write_risk_state() appends to portfolio_risk_state.json (append-only).

  E6  Brier Calibration Loop (brier_calibration_loop.py)
      Pre-register: write_forecast_record() → nite_pei_brier_ledger.json
      Resolve:    resolve_forecast(record_id, outcome=0|1) →
                    brier_score = (p_posterior - outcome)²
                    direction_correct = (delta_p > 0) == (outcome == 1)
                    LR adjust (if not locked):
                      Wrong direction: lr = 1.0 + (lr-1.0) × 0.85  (15% shrink)
                      Correct + bs < 0.10: lr = 1.0 + (lr-1.0) × 1.05  (5% boost)
                    Confidence: n<10 → LOW | n<30 → MEDIUM | n≥30 → HIGH
      Reuse:     from pei.brier_crs_engine import brier_score, crs_decomposition

  E7  Kelly-NITE + Entropy-NITE Coherence Gate (kelly_nite_coupler.py)
      H_norm:    Mean signal_entropy_normalized from acms_cop.classifiers
      Dispersion: Std dev of PEI scenario branch probabilities
      Coherence: 1 - (H_norm×0.5 + dispersion×0.5)  → [0, 1]
      Frac mult: 0.05 + (0.35 - 0.05) × coherence   → [0.05, 0.35]
      Kelly:     f_star_full = (b×p - q)/b
                 f_star_kelly = max(0, f_star_full × frac_mult)
      Vector:    target_usd = NAV × f_star_kelly
                 delta_usd = target_usd - current_usd_sleeve

3.2 CIO ADVISORY RENDERER (cio_advisory_renderer.py)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Posture rules (thesis §5 Step 17):
    KILL_CONDITION_CONFIRMED — any kill state is CONFIRMED
    THESIS_RETIRED           — all kill states are RETIRED
    THESIS_STRENGTHENED      — delta_p ≥ +0.15, no active kill trigger
    THESIS_WEAKENED          — delta_p ≤ -0.15, kill state ≥ TRIGGERED
    THESIS_UNCHANGED         — |delta_p| < 0.15

  Contradiction rules evaluated at block build time:
    NITEPEI-001 (P3): P_posterior < 0.30 AND agent recommends ADD/BUY
    NITEPEI-002 (P1): CKRI in HIGH/CRITICAL AND agent council reports no risk_flags

  Canonical nite_pei{} block fields:
    schema_version, generated_at_sgt, thesis_probability_snapshots,
    ckri, ckri_zone, ckri_detail, kelly_advisories,
    nite_pei_contradictions, nite_pei_contradiction_count, nite_pei_p1_count,
    manual_execution_required, llm_order_generation, order_routing_enabled

3.3 DUAL ACTION GATE (BLV3-DOCTRINE-007)
─────────────────────────────────────────

  equity_action_gate.py
    Handles:  CKRI de-risk advisory for equity sleeve ONLY
    Excludes: VXX, VIXY (frozenset constant — architectural, not advisory)
    Actions:  NO_ACTION / MONITOR / FREEZE_NEW_ADDS / RISK_REVIEW_REQUIRED /
              RAISE_CASH_REVIEW based on CKRI zone
    DOCTRINE: De-risk from high CKRI must NEVER trigger hedge reduction

  hedge_action_gate.py
    Handles:  VXX and VIXY sizing ONLY
    CKRI multiplier applied in correct direction:
      HIGH → 1.25× target; CRITICAL → 1.50× target
    Invariant: High CKRI INCREASES hedge target — never reduces it
    DOCTRINE: Hedge is the antidote to what CKRI measures

  OBSERVATION LOCK (v3_4_observation_lock.json):
    NITE-PEI is a net-new module addition, not an ARCHITECTURE_REFACTOR of protected
    layers. CIO blessing (WO-20260621-002) covers the addition. BlueLotus V2 and
    protected V3 layers (bluelotus_publisher.py protected sections) were not mutated.
    The single publisher modification (line 3521) adds one key to an existing dict —
    not a structural change to the publisher's architecture.


6. SAFETY INVARIANTS VERIFICATION
──────────────────────────────────

  ✓  manual_execution_required = True  (all 11 NITE-PEI modules; asserted in tests)
  ✓  llm_order_generation = False      (all 11 NITE-PEI modules; asserted in tests)

  ✓  Append-only files: portfolio_risk_state.json, calibration_audit_log.json,
                         nite_pei_brier_ledger.json
  ✓  Brier ledger locked entries (calibration_n ≥ 100) skipped in calibration loop
  ✓  No LLM calls in any NITE-PEI file
  ✓  No broker / order routing calls in any NITE-PEI file
  ✓  BlueLotus V2 architecture not touched
  ✓  No existing test files modified


7. INTEGRATION POINTS
─────────────────────

  NITE-PEI reads from:
    config/thesis_registry.yaml              thesis priors, kill conditions
    nite_pei/likelihood_ratio_table.yaml     event LR values
    data/pei/prospective_event_intelligence_latest.json  branch dispersion
    dataset_raw.json → portfolio.positions   NAV and current holdings
    acms_cop/classifiers/signal_entropy_classifier.py    H_norm (signal entropy)
    pei/brier_crs_engine.py                  CRS decomposition (reused)

  NITE-PEI writes to:
    config/thesis_registry.yaml              current_probability, probability_history
    nite_pei/portfolio_risk_state.json       CKRI audit log (append-only)
    nite_pei/calibration_audit_log.json      Brier calibration events (append-only)
    data/nite_pei_brier_ledger.json          Forecast pre-registration (append-only)

  NITE-PEI publishes to:
    v3_agents_latest.json → nite_pei{}       via bluelotus_publisher.py build_v3_agents_json()

  NITE-PEI is consumed by:
    Chief Strategist HTML section "NITE-PEI Thesis Updates" (advisory text)
    Contradiction register (NITEPEI-001, NITEPEI-002 rules)
    CIO Decision Strip (posture field feeds downstream)


8. KNOWN LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
─────────────────────────────────────

  LR TABLE CALIBRATION (current state: expert-initialized)
    All LR entries have calibration_n = 0 and confidence = LOW.
    The Brier calibration loop is fully implemented and ready to use, but
    no real forecast outcomes have been resolved yet. LR values will gain
    MEDIUM confidence after 10 resolutions, HIGH after 30.
    Recommended: begin resolving forecasts quarterly as theses mature.

  KEYWORD TAXONOMY (22 classes)
    The event classifier uses keyword matching only. No semantic similarity.
    False negatives (UNKNOWN classification) are safe — LR defaults to 1.0
    (no probability update). Taxonomy can be extended without code changes
    by adding entries to _TAXONOMY in event_classifier.py.

  THESIS REGISTRY KILL CONDITIONS
    All 10 kill conditions across 5 theses initialize at P_kill = 0.05 (INACTIVE).
    Kill condition weights and trigger class lists are expert-initialized.
    Recommend CIO review of kill weights after first full NITE-PEI cycle.

  PEI BRANCH DISPERSION
    get_branch_dispersion() defaults to 0.50 if PEI latest JSON is absent.
    As the PEI module accumulates scenario trees, dispersion will be computed
    dynamically. Current default produces a mid-range Coherence Gate output.

  PUBLISHER INJECTION
    The nite_pei{} block is published as-is from v3_data.get("nite_pei", {}).
    The upstream cycle runner must populate v3_data["nite_pei"] by calling
    build_nite_pei_block() before invoking build_v3_agents_json().
    Wiring to the cycle runner is out of scope for WO-20260621-002.


9. DOCTRINE RECORD
──────────────────

  BLV3-DOCTRINE-007 (new, appended 2026-06-21):
    Title:   "Dual action gate separation: equity vs. hedge"
    ID:      BLV3-DOCTRINE-007
    Status:  active
    Author:  Dr. Claude Code — Windows Platform Team
    Summary: De-risk actions from NITE-PEI CKRI route to equity_action_gate only.
             VXX and VIXY are governed exclusively by hedge_action_gate.
             Architectural separation enforced in code, not in CIO memory.

  Pre-existing doctrines unchanged:
    BLV3-DOCTRINE-001  Memory before aesthetics
    BLV3-DOCTRINE-002  Governance before automation
    BLV3-DOCTRINE-003  CIO-only manual execution
    BLV3-DOCTRINE-004  Protect V2 as source of record
    BLV3-DOCTRINE-005  Auditability before speed
    BLV3-DOCTRINE-006  No options as investment instruments
