DR. CODEX AUDIT REPORT
BlueLotus V3 NITE-PEI Engine Implementation by Dr. Claude Code
Date: 2026-06-21 SGT
Prepared for: CIO, Dr. Claude Code, Chief Architect ChatGPT 5.5
===============================================================================

AUDIT SCOPE
-----------
User requested audit of Dr. Claude Code's completed WO-20260621-002:

  C:\bluelotus3\research\WORKORDER_NITEPEI_Integrated_Thesis_20260621.txt

Claude completion report:

  C:\bluelotus3\research\BlueLotus_ThesisReport_NITEPEI_20260621.txt

This audit reviewed:

  - New nite_pei/ modules
  - thesis_registry.yaml schema extension
  - v3_doctrine_seed.json doctrine extension
  - bluelotus_publisher.py integration
  - test_nite_pei_engine.py coverage
  - public v3_agents_latest.json state
  - targeted adversarial probes

No implementation files were changed during this audit.

===============================================================================
SOP OBSERVATION
---------------
Claude Code successfully created a substantial NITE-PEI library layer:

  - 11 Python modules compile.
  - 71 NITE-PEI acceptance tests pass.
  - Full V3 suite passes: 305 passed, 1 pre-existing warning.
  - Doctrine 007 is present.
  - Thesis registry was extended to v1.1 with probabilities and kill conditions.
  - Safety invariants are mostly preserved at module output level.

However, audit found a sharp distinction:

  Claude built NITE-PEI components.
  Claude did not fully wire NITE-PEI into the live V3 production cycle.

Public v3_agents_latest.json, checked after Claude's work:

  cycle_id:       v3_cycle_20260621_015635
  generated_at:   2026-06-21 02:47 SGT
  has_nite_pei:   false

System search outside nite_pei/ and tests found only:

  C:\bluelotus3\mid\bluelotus_publisher.py:3521
    "nite_pei": v3_data.get("nite_pei", {})

No orchestration runner, agent cycle, or data builder currently calls:

  build_nite_pei_block()
  update_thesis()
  compute_ckri_from_registry()
  build_kelly_advisory()
  equity_de_risk_advisory()
  hedge_sizing_advisory()

===============================================================================
FINDINGS
===============================================================================

[P1] LR noise discount formula can reverse or amplify evidence incorrectly
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
File:

  C:\bluelotus3\nite_pei\bayesian_updater.py:99

Current logic:

  lr_adjusted = lr_raw * (1.0 - noise_discount_factor)

Observed probe:

  LR 1.00 with 50% discount -> LR 0.50
  LR 0.60 with 50% discount -> LR 0.30
  LR 0.80 with 50% discount -> LR 0.40

Why this matters:

  A noise discount should reduce evidentiary force toward neutral LR=1.0.
  The current formula does that only for LR > 1.0.

  For LR < 1.0, it strengthens bearish evidence instead of weakening it.
  For LR = 1.0, it turns neutral evidence bearish.

Consequence:

  A low-quality or T4 bearish/de-risk event can move thesis probabilities more
  violently than a high-quality event. This is mathematically unsafe for a
  Bayesian thesis engine.

Recommended fix:

  Discount in log-odds / LR-distance space:

    lr_adjusted = 1.0 + (lr_raw - 1.0) * (1.0 - noise_discount_factor)

  Examples with 50% discount:

    LR 1.40 -> 1.20
    LR 1.00 -> 1.00
    LR 0.60 -> 0.80

Acceptance tests needed:

  - Neutral LR remains neutral under any discount.
  - Bullish LR moves toward 1.0.
  - Bearish LR moves toward 1.0.

===============================================================================

[P1] NITE-PEI is not wired into the live V3 cycle or public JSON yet
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Evidence:

  Public endpoint:
    https://sohweekian.github.io/bluelotus/data/v3_agents_latest.json

  Audit result:
    has_nite_pei = false

  Search outside new modules/tests:
    only bluelotus_publisher.py line 3521 references nite_pei.

Why this matters:

  The engine exists as a library, but no production cycle currently:

    - classifies incoming news events,
    - updates thesis probabilities,
    - writes Brier forecast records,
    - computes CKRI,
    - builds Kelly-NITE advisories,
    - passes nite_pei{} into publisher data.

  Therefore CIO cannot yet rely on the dashboard/report to show live NITE-PEI
  results.

Recommended fix:

  Add a dedicated orchestration bridge, e.g.

    orchestration/run_nite_pei_cycle.py
    or mid/run_nite_pei_update.py

  Then call it from V3 grand cycle before publisher payload build.

Acceptance tests needed:

  - One test cycle produces v3_data["nite_pei"].
  - Public v3_agents_latest.json contains non-empty nite_pei{}.
  - nite_pei.thesis_probability_snapshots has at least one real or explicit
    no-event snapshot.

===============================================================================

[P2] Chief Strategist HTML section claimed by work order is absent
------------------------------------------------------------------
Work order required:

  Add "NITE-PEI Thesis Updates" HTML section to chief-strategist renderer.

Audit search:

  rg "NITE-PEI Thesis Updates|build_nite_pei_block|nite_pei" bluelotus_publisher.py

Result:

  Only line 3521:
    "nite_pei": v3_data.get("nite_pei", {})

No HTML renderer section exists.

Why this matters:

  Even after the orchestration bridge is added, the Chief Strategist page will
  not visibly render the NITE-PEI advisory section unless publisher HTML is
  extended.

Recommended fix:

  Add a render_nite_pei_section(v3_data) function and insert it into
  chief-strategist.html generation.

Acceptance tests needed:

  - HTML contains "NITE-PEI Thesis Updates" when nite_pei{} has data.
  - Empty nite_pei{} does not create misleading blank section.

===============================================================================

[P2] Source-tier parser silently downgrades string tiers to T2
-------------------------------------------------------------
File:

  C:\bluelotus3\nite_pei\event_classifier.py:185

Current logic:

  tier = int(source_tier) if source_tier in _TIER_DISCOUNT else 2

Observed probe:

  source_tier = 1    -> T1, discount 0.00
  source_tier = "1"  -> T2, discount 0.10
  source_tier = "T1" -> T2, discount 0.10
  source_tier = 4    -> T4, discount 0.50
  source_tier = "4"  -> T2, discount 0.10
  source_tier = "T4" -> T2, discount 0.10

Why this matters:

  News pipelines often encode tiers as "T1", "T2", "1", or strings.
  The current parser treats those as unknown and defaults them to T2.

Consequence:

  High-quality T1 sources can be incorrectly discounted.
  Low-quality T4 sources can be incorrectly promoted.

Recommended fix:

  Add parse_source_tier(source_tier):

    - accepts int 1..4
    - accepts "1".."4"
    - accepts "T1".."T4"
    - unknown -> T3 or explicit UNKNOWN_SOURCE policy, not silent T2 unless
      doctrine says T2 default.

Acceptance tests needed:

  - classify_event(..., "T1") returns source_tier=1.
  - classify_event(..., "T4") returns source_tier=4.
  - classify_event(..., "4") returns source_tier=4.

===============================================================================

[P2] Brier "append-only" invariant is only partially true
---------------------------------------------------------
File:

  C:\bluelotus3\nite_pei\brier_calibration_loop.py:175-178

Current resolve_forecast() mutates the existing ledger record:

  record["resolution_pending"] = False
  record["final_outcome"] = outcome_int
  record["brier_score"] = bs
  record["direction_correct"] = direction_correct

Why this matters:

  Work order says append-only memory and "records are never deleted or
  overwritten." Updating the same forecast record in place loses the original
  unresolved state as a separate immutable artifact.

This may be acceptable if BlueLotus defines "append-only" as "no deletion, but
status fields may update." But it is not strict immutability.

Recommended fix:

  Choose one doctrine:

  Option A: strict immutable ledger
    - write forecast_created record
    - append forecast_resolved record
    - derive current state by folding records

  Option B: operational ledger
    - allow in-place resolution update
    - rename invariant from append-only to audit-backed mutable status
    - keep calibration_audit_log append-only

===============================================================================

[P3] Test suite proves modules, not live integration
---------------------------------------------------
Claude's tests pass:

  test_nite_pei_engine.py: 71 passed
  full suite: 305 passed

But the suite does not currently assert:

  - V3 grand cycle calls NITE-PEI.
  - publisher receives non-empty nite_pei{}.
  - public JSON contains nite_pei{}.
  - Chief Strategist HTML renders NITE-PEI section.
  - source-tier string parsing.
  - LR discount symmetry around 1.0.

Recommended fix:

  Add integration tests in a new file:

    tests/test_nite_pei_v3_integration.py

Minimum acceptance tests:

  - build latest V3 payload with a mock nite_pei block and verify JSON key.
  - render Chief Strategist with nite_pei block and verify HTML section.
  - run NITE-PEI bridge on synthetic event and verify thesis update + brier record.

===============================================================================
TEST RESULTS FROM AUDIT
-----------------------

Compile:

  python -m py_compile nite_pei/*.py mid/bluelotus_publisher.py

Result:

  PASS, with pre-existing publisher SyntaxWarning around invalid escape sequence.

Narrow NITE-PEI tests:

  python -m pytest C:\bluelotus3\tests\test_nite_pei_engine.py -q

Result:

  71 passed

Full V3 tests:

  python -m pytest C:\bluelotus3\tests -q

Result:

  305 passed, 1 warning

Warning:

  tests/test_v3_db_connection.py::test_v3_connection returns True instead of
  using assert. This warning is pre-existing and not related to NITE-PEI.

===============================================================================
VERDICT
-------

Claude Code delivered a strong foundation layer, but not a completed live
production NITE-PEI engine.

Classification:

  FOUNDATION: PASS
  UNIT TESTS: PASS
  SAFETY INVARIANTS: MOSTLY PASS
  LIVE ORCHESTRATION: NOT WIRED
  PUBLIC DASHBOARD: NOT WIRED
  BAYESIAN LR DISCOUNT MATH: NEEDS FIX BEFORE LIVE USE

Recommended operational status:

  NITE-PEI should remain DISABLED / LIBRARY-ONLY until P1 and P2 findings are
  cleared.

Do not rely on NITE-PEI outputs for CIO dashboard decisions yet, because live
outputs are not present and the LR noise-discount math can distort probabilities.

===============================================================================
ADDENDUM — CURRENT-STATE RECONCILIATION AFTER CONTINUED AUDIT
===============================================================================

During continued audit, additional files and runtime artifacts were observed that
were not visible in the first narrow search snapshot. This addendum supersedes
the earlier "not wired at all" wording and replaces it with a more precise state:

  NITE-PEI is partially wired through a standalone runner and publisher pickup,
  but it is not yet persistent in the regular V3 24/7 pipeline cadence.

Additional observed files:

  C:\bluelotus3\scripts\run_nite_pei_cycle.py
  C:\bluelotus3\mid\nite_pei_report_builder.py
  C:\bluelotus3\data\v3_cycles\v3_cycle_20260621_024733\nite_pei_block.json
  C:\bluelotus3\reports\bluelotus_v3_nite_pei_report.txt
  C:\bluelotus3\reports\bluelotus_v3_nite_pei_report.docx
  C:\bluelotus3\reports\bluelotus_v3_nite_pei_report.xlsx

Additional publisher integration:

  C:\bluelotus3\mid\bluelotus_publisher.py:3374-3382
    Loads nite_pei_block.json from a cycle folder if present.

  C:\bluelotus3\mid\bluelotus_publisher.py:3991-4024
    Appends NITE-PEI section to TXT report and writes standalone NITE-PEI
    TXT/Word/Excel reports.

Corrected integration finding:

  The system can publish NITE-PEI data when a specific cycle folder contains:

    nite_pei_block.json

  But the regular pipeline did not create that file for later cycles.

Cycle observation:

  v3_cycle_20260621_024733  -> HasNitePei = True
  v3_cycle_20260621_035214  -> HasNitePei = False
  v3_cycle_20260621_045621  -> HasNitePei = False
  v3_cycle_20260621_060039  -> HasNitePei = False

Public endpoint after regular pipeline publish:

  cycle_id:          v3_cycle_20260621_045621
  generated_at:      2026-06-21 06:00 SGT
  has_nite_pei_key:  true
  nite_pei_empty:    true
  nite_pei_keys:     []

Pipeline log:

  V3 RUN 64 executed:
    orchestration.run_v3_grand_cycle --persist-db

  No invocation of:
    python -m scripts.run_nite_pei_cycle

Therefore, the current production problem is:

  The standalone NITE-PEI runner works at least once, but it is not called by
  the recurring V3 intelligence pipeline before publisher execution. The result
  is a non-durable integration: one cycle had NITE-PEI, later live cycles did not.

===============================================================================
ADDITIONAL FINDINGS
===============================================================================

[P1] NITE-PEI runner uses static embedded events, not live dataset extraction
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
File:

  C:\bluelotus3\scripts\run_nite_pei_cycle.py:46-103

Current implementation:

  REAL_EVENTS = [
      "Iran Closes Strait Of Hormuz ...",
      "Fed Governor Bowman Spoke ...",
      "Yen carry-trade unwind risk ...",
      "FOMC June 16-17 rate decision risk ..."
  ]

Why this matters:

  The script header says it runs against real events from the dataset, but the
  code uses a hardcoded REAL_EVENTS list. Even if these were copied from the
  dataset during implementation, they are now static and will repeat every time
  the runner is called.

Consequence:

  Re-running NITE-PEI can repeatedly update thesis probabilities from the same
  stale embedded events. That risks probability drift and false learning.

Recommended fix:

  Replace REAL_EVENTS with deterministic extraction from dataset_raw.json:

    - news/signals/latest event rows
    - macro_event_risks
    - thesis-specific event streams

  Each event must have a stable event_id. The runner should skip event_id values
  already applied to the same thesis unless a new version/revision exists.

Acceptance tests needed:

  - No hardcoded headline list in runner.
  - Same event_id cannot update the same thesis twice.
  - Missing event feed produces explicit no_event cycle, not stale repetition.

===============================================================================

[P1] Regular V3 pipeline does not invoke NITE-PEI runner
-------------------------------------------------------
Evidence:

  C:\bluelotus3\logs\v3_pipeline_loop_20260615_092212.log

  The 06:00 pipeline executed:

    orchestration.run_v3_grand_cycle --persist-db
    bluelotus_publisher.py

  It did not execute:

    python -m scripts.run_nite_pei_cycle

Current effect:

  Publisher can load nite_pei_block.json if present, but later V3 cycles do not
  produce the block. The website then publishes:

    "nite_pei": {}

Recommended fix:

  Add NITE-PEI as a durable pipeline step after grand cycle completion and before
  publisher:

    1. run_v3_grand_cycle writes cycle folder
    2. scripts.run_nite_pei_cycle writes nite_pei_block.json into that same folder
    3. bluelotus_publisher.py publishes v3_agents_latest.json and reports

Acceptance tests needed:

  - Latest cycle folder has nite_pei_block.json after one pipeline pass.
  - Public v3_agents_latest.json has non-empty nite_pei{} after publisher.
  - If NITE-PEI fails, publisher displays explicit degraded_nite_pei status
    instead of silently publishing {}.

===============================================================================

[P2] NITE-PEI block was generated after the target cycle's core timestamps
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Observed:

  v3_cycle_20260621_024733 cycle files: around 02:47-02:49 SGT
  nite_pei_block.json: 03:38 SGT

Why this matters:

  A NITE-PEI block written long after its target cycle can mix later registry
  state with an earlier agent cycle. This can be acceptable for a backfill or
  manual enrichment pass, but the public report should label it as such.

Recommended fix:

  Add fields to nite_pei_block.json:

    source_cycle_id
    source_cycle_created_at_sgt
    nite_pei_generated_at_sgt
    generation_mode: live_cycle | manual_backfill | recovery

===============================================================================

[P2] Brier pre-registration is not used by the standalone runner
----------------------------------------------------------------
Work order required a Brier pre-registration loop.

The module exists:

  C:\bluelotus3\nite_pei\brier_calibration_loop.py

But the runner import list does not include write_forecast_record(), and search
does not show it being called by the runner.

Observed:

  C:\bluelotus3\data\nite_pei_brier_ledger.json -> []

Why this matters:

  The probability updates are not yet Brier-gradeable through the NITE-PEI
  ledger, even though the Brier calibration module exists.

Recommended fix:

  During each thesis update, call write_forecast_record() and store the returned
  brier_record_id in:

    - thesis probability history
    - nite_pei_block thesis snapshot

===============================================================================

REVISED VERDICT
---------------

Claude Code's NITE-PEI delivery is stronger than a library-only scaffold, because
there is now a standalone runner, publisher pickup, and standalone TXT/Word/Excel
report generation.

But the layer is not yet production-durable:

  - Not called by the regular 39-minute / 24-7 V3 pipeline.
  - Latest public JSON currently publishes nite_pei: {}.
  - Runner uses static embedded event list.
  - LR discount math remains unsafe.
  - NITE-PEI Brier ledger remains empty.

Operational classification:

  FOUNDATION: PASS
  STANDALONE RUNNER: PARTIAL PASS
  PUBLISHER PICKUP: PARTIAL PASS
  REGULAR PIPELINE INTEGRATION: FAIL
  LIVE PUBLIC JSON DURABILITY: FAIL
  BAYESIAN DISCOUNT MATH: FAIL UNTIL FIXED
  BRIER PRE-REGISTRATION: NOT ACTIVE

Recommended status:

  NITE-PEI should remain EXPERIMENTAL / OBSERVE ONLY until the P1 items are fixed.
