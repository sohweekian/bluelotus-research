DR. CODEX THESIS OBSERVATIONS
NITE-PEI Durability, Bayesian Correctness, and Pipeline Integration
Date: 2026-06-21 SGT
Prepared by: Dr. Codex, Windows Platform Team
===============================================================================

OBSERVATION
-----------
Dr. Claude Code successfully built a substantial NITE-PEI foundation:

  - deterministic event classifier
  - likelihood-ratio table
  - Bayesian updater
  - kill-condition state machine
  - CKRI calculator
  - Kelly-NITE coupler
  - CIO advisory renderer
  - equity/hedge gate separation
  - standalone NITE-PEI report builder

However, audit found four operating defects that prevent NITE-PEI from being a
durable production layer:

  1. LR noise discount moves LR values by multiplication against zero instead of
     toward neutral LR=1.0.

  2. The standalone runner uses a static REAL_EVENTS list, so repeated runs can
     reapply stale events.

  3. The regular V3 pipeline does not invoke the NITE-PEI runner, so later live
     cycles publish nite_pei: {}.

  4. Brier forecast pre-registration exists as a module but is not active in the
     runner, leaving the NITE-PEI Brier ledger empty.

THESIS
------
NITE-PEI is not complete when its modules compile. It is complete only when:

  - Bayesian evidence discounting is mathematically neutral-preserving.
  - Live event extraction replaces static event lists.
  - Event IDs prevent duplicate thesis probability updates.
  - Brier records are pre-registered for every probability update.
  - Each regular V3 cycle produces a NITE-PEI block before publisher execution.
  - Public v3_agents_latest.json contains a non-empty nite_pei{} block or an
    explicit degraded/no-event status.

HYPOTHESIS
----------
If the LR discount formula is changed to pull LR toward 1.0, source tiers are
parsed robustly, the runner extracts real events from dataset_raw.json with
stable event IDs, and the recurring V3 pipeline calls the runner before the
publisher, then NITE-PEI will become a durable production-adjacent layer without
violating CIO_ONLY_MANUAL governance.

TESTABLE CLAIMS
---------------
Acceptance criteria:

  AT1: LR 1.0 remains 1.0 under all discounts.
  AT2: LR > 1.0 discounts downward toward 1.0.
  AT3: LR < 1.0 discounts upward toward 1.0.
  AT4: source tiers "1", "T1", "4", "T4" parse correctly.
  AT5: runner no longer contains static REAL_EVENTS as the operating event feed.
  AT6: runner writes brier_record_id into thesis snapshots.
  AT7: duplicate event_id cannot update the same thesis twice.
  AT8: pipeline config includes the NITE-PEI step before publisher.
  AT9: latest cycle folder receives nite_pei_block.json after the repair run.
  AT10: public v3_agents_latest.json contains non-empty nite_pei{} after publish.

SAFETY INVARIANTS
-----------------
No broker execution.
No LLM-generated orders.
No automatic portfolio action.
All outputs remain CIO advisory only.
VXX/VIXY remain governed only by hedge_action_gate.
