DR. CODEX TECHNICAL REPORT
NITE-PEI Durability Patch: Bayesian Correctness + Pipeline Integration
Date: 2026-06-21 SGT
Prepared for: CIO, Dr. Claude Code, Chief Architect ChatGPT 5.5
===============================================================================

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------
Dr. Codex audited the NITE-PEI implementation and found that Dr. Claude Code had
built a meaningful foundation, but the layer was not yet production-durable.

This patch converts NITE-PEI from partially wired experimental machinery into a
durable V3 pipeline step:

  - LR discount math corrected.
  - Source-tier parsing hardened.
  - Static runner event list replaced with live dataset extraction.
  - Duplicate event guard added.
  - Brier preregistration activated.
  - Pipeline order corrected: grand cycle -> NITE-PEI -> publisher.
  - Public v3_agents_latest.json now carries non-empty nite_pei{}.

Safety remains intact:

  - no broker routing
  - no LLM order generation
  - manual execution required
  - CIO_ONLY_MANUAL preserved

===============================================================================
4. DEFECTS FIXED
----------------

[FIX-1] LR noise discount corrected

Old formula:

  lr_adjusted = lr_raw * (1 - noise_discount)

Problem:

  LR 1.0 with 50% discount became 0.5.
  LR 0.6 with 50% discount became 0.3.

This turned neutral evidence bearish and made adverse evidence stronger.

New formula:

  lr_adjusted = 1 + (lr_raw - 1) * (1 - noise_discount)

Result:

  LR 1.4, 50% discount -> 1.2
  LR 1.0, 50% discount -> 1.0
  LR 0.6, 50% discount -> 0.8

[FIX-2] Source-tier parsing hardened

Now accepts:

  1, "1", "T1"
  2, "2", "T2"
  3, "3", "T3"
  4, "4", "T4"

Unknown tier defaults to T3, not silently promoted to T2.

[FIX-3] Static event list removed

The runner no longer uses a fixed REAL_EVENTS operating feed.

It now extracts candidate events from:

  - dataset_raw.json -> signals_latest
  - dataset_raw.json -> macro_event_risks
  - dataset_raw.json -> ticker_sentiment headlines

Each event receives a stable event_id.

[FIX-4] Duplicate event guard added

The runner reads thesis probability_history and skips event_id values already
applied to that thesis. Repeated pipeline cycles no longer keep reapplying the
same news event.

[FIX-5] Brier preregistration activated

Each thesis probability update with applied events now writes a NITE-PEI Brier
forecast record. The brier_record_id is stored in probability history and the
NITE-PEI thesis snapshot.

[FIX-6] Pipeline durability fixed

Pipeline tail is now:

  Step 63: orchestration.run_v3_grand_cycle --persist-db
  Step 64: scripts.run_nite_pei_cycle
  Step 65: bluelotus_publisher.py

This ensures NITE-PEI writes into the fresh cycle before publisher runs.

===============================================================================
5. LIVE DEFECT DISCOVERED DURING TESTING
----------------------------------------
During the first live verification run, NITE-PEI classified:

  "Monitoring governance: alerts 4 | critical 0 | warnings 3"

as:

  GEOPOLITICAL_ESCALATION

Root cause:

  The old classifier used substring matching. The keyword "war" matched inside
  "warnings" and "warns".

Fix:

  Added boundary-safe keyword matching in event_classifier.py.

Result:

  "warnings" no longer matches "war".
  "warns" no longer matches "war".

Regression test added:

  test_keyword_matching_does_not_read_warnings_as_war

===============================================================================
6. STATE CORRECTION AFTER FALSE-POSITIVE RUN
--------------------------------------------
The false-positive test run wrote probability updates and Brier records before
the defect was discovered.

No history was deleted.

Correction action:

  - Appended correction records to thesis probability_history.
  - Recomputed latest thesis probabilities using the fixed classifier.
  - Restored PETRO kill condition from false CONFIRMED to corrected TRIGGERED.
  - Marked five bad Brier records as invalidated_by_correction.
  - Created five corrected Brier records.

Corrected current probabilities:

  TRUMP_UNCERTAINTY_THESIS      0.428754
  PETRO_RECYCLED_DOLLAR_THESIS  0.584123
  STICKY_INFLATION_THESIS       0.669714
  HAWKISH_WARSH_THESIS          0.891768
  HAWKISH_BOJ_THESIS            0.935902

Corrected CKRI:

  CKRI      0.343412
  CKRI zone WATCH

===============================================================================
7. TEST RESULTS
---------------
Compile:

  python -m py_compile nite_pei/*.py scripts/run_nite_pei_cycle.py

Result:

  PASS

Targeted NITE-PEI tests:

  python -m pytest tests/test_nite_pei_engine.py tests/test_nite_pei_integration.py -q

Result:

  81 passed

Full V3 suite:

  python -m pytest tests -q

Result:

  315 passed, 1 warning

Warning:

  tests/test_v3_db_connection.py returns True instead of using assert.
  This is pre-existing and unrelated.

Pipeline dry-run:

  python -m orchestration.run_v3_intelligence_pipeline --once --dry-run

Result:

  ok: true
  steps: 65
  order confirmed:
    grand cycle -> NITE-PEI -> publisher

===============================================================================
9. REMAINING WATCH ITEMS
------------------------
1. Publisher still emits a pre-existing SyntaxWarning around an invalid escape
   sequence in the catalyst calendar script block. It does not block publish.

2. Standalone NITE-PEI TXT/Word/Excel reports are intentionally not regenerated
   by publisher now. Publisher comment says content is embedded into the main
   V3 report per BLV3-ACCOUNTABILITY-001.

3. NITE-PEI remains advisory. It should be observed over multiple live cycles
   before using its probability numbers as a high-confidence CIO decision aid.

===============================================================================
10. FINAL VERDICT
-----------------
Before this patch:

  NITE-PEI was a strong foundation but not durable in the live pipeline.

After this patch:

  NITE-PEI is wired into the V3 pipeline, publishes a non-empty canonical block,
  extracts live events, avoids duplicate event drift, preserves Bayesian LR
  neutrality, and writes Brier-gradeable records.

Operational status:

  NITE-PEI: LIVE / WATCH
  Production authority: ADVISORY ONLY
  Execution authority: CIO_ONLY_MANUAL
